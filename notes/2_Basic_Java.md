## Types More Detail

There are more differences on structure and memory

* primitive types:
    
    * have no internal structure
    * uses a small, fixed amount of memory
* object types:
    
    * contain internal structure (references to other primitives or objects)
    * use varying, sometimes large amounts of memory

## Mutating values vs. reassigning variables

* immutable type

```java
String s = "a";
s += "b";
```
